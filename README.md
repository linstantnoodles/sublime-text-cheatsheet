# Cheatsheet

**Goal:** a single file that represents all of sublimes features that is OS agnostic and digestable for beginners and advanced users alike.

This sheet serves also exists to succeed in serving two main purposes through its content:

* As an effective reference
* As an effective learning / mastery tool

## Tasks

### Establishing structure

I think this is the piece that a lot of cheatsheets can improve on. A cheatsheet is useless if the information is organized in such a way that commands are difficult to find. When you're programming, you don't want to expend more mental effort than is appropriate just to find a shortcut key. This is hard to get right but it's the most important thing to get right.

- [x] create content structure. no shortcut info here yet. (IN PROGRESS). See the file `shortcuts.osx.md` for progress.
    - [x] Part 1: Things you do to the contents of a file
        - [x] navigating cursor aroud text
            - [x] moving cursor
            - [x] jumping cursor
        - [x] selecting text
            - [x] selection using cursor motion
            - [x] special selection
        - [x] editing text
            - inserting
            - transposing
            - duplicating
            - deleting
        - [x] text visibility
            - code folding
    - [ ] Other content:
        - installation
        - ideal finger to key mappings
        - search panel
        - replace panel
        - panel options
        - search and replace project wide
        - window management
            - creating a new buffer
            - switching buffers
            - new window
            - moving buffer from one window to the next
            - closing / hiding certain windows like the explorer
        - marking positions / bookmarkin
        - macros
        - creating new file
        - opening a file
        - finding a file
        - package management
        - editor configuration
            - syntax
            - settings
            - useful basic settings
            - project specific
        - writing plugins
        - publishing plugins
        - useful plugins and how to use
        - refactoring efficiencies
        - window stuff
            - console
            - sidebar
            - minimap
            - search / replace panels

- [x] format it to make it somewhat presentable :)

### Adding shortcuts

Many cheatsheets also suffer in that they are either for linux, windows, or mac. Ideally, we should come up with something that addresses all the operating systems that support sublime. Maybe this means coming up with a special notation that is defined up front. Maybe we can generate OS specific sheets programmatically.

Whatever the solution here will be, it should NOT force people to install anything or visit a website. That's silly. A plugin is also way overkill. Ideally, it's just a file that can be added to a project and git-ignored. That way, finding the information is as easy as looking up the file.

- [x] add shortcuts for mac osx
- [ ] add shortcuts for windows (we should do this programmatically. could use some outside help here)
