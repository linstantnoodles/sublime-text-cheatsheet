# Cheatsheet

**Goal:** a single file that represents all of sublimes features that is OS agnostic and digestable for beginners and advanced users alike.

## Tasks


### Establishing structure

I think this is the piece that a lot of cheatsheets can improve on. A cheatsheet is useless if the information is organized in such a way that commands are difficult to find. When you're programming, you don't want to expend more mental effort than is appropriate just to find a shortcut key. This is hard to get right but it's the most important thing to get right.

- [ ] create content structure. no shortcut info here yet.
- [ ] format it to make it somewhat presentable :)

### Adding shortcuts

Many cheatsheets also suffer in that they are either for linux, windows, or mac. Ideally, we should come up with something that addresses all the operating systems that support sublime. Maybe this means coming up with a special notation that is defined up front. Maybe we can generate OS specific sheets programmatically.

Whatever the solution here will be, it should NOT force people to install anything or visit a website. That's silly. A plugin is also way overkill. Ideally, it's just a file that can be added to a project and git-ignored. That way, finding the information is as easy as looking up the file.

- [ ] add shortcuts for mac osx
- [ ] add shortcuts for windows (we should do this programmatically. could use some outside help here)
