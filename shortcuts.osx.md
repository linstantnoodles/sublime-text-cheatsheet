# Terminology

I've added the concept of levels to the sheet in order to make it serve not just as a reference resource but also as a learning and/or teaching resource. The levels do not *always* accurately represent a progression of difficulty, but it's organized so that level 3 is much more attainable if you've mastered the previous two levels.

Level 1 (L1)
---
* Most frequently used
* Single key
* Familiar keys (arrow keys). If you're even reading this, then you probably know how to use these to move around in an editor.

Level 2 (L2)
---
* Medium usage
* Multiple key combination (usually no more than two)
* Somewhat familiar if you've used shortcuts in other apps / editors but these are mostly specific to sublime

Level 3 (L3)
---
* Least frequently used
* Multiple key combination (sometimes more than two)
* Very specific to sublime

For shortcuts whose purpose isn't obvious, there will be a short description for a use case included.

## Selecting text to manipulate

**Select ...**

This is a natural extension of knowing how to move your cursor around because a selection is a chunk of text that's been selected between your starting cursor and ending cursor position.

If you know the shortcut for moving a cursor to the end of a word, then you'll know how to create a selection to the end of a word!
