# Terminology

I've added the concept of levels to the sheet in order to make it serve not just as a reference resource but also as a learning and/or teaching resource. The levels do not *always* accurately represent a progression of difficulty, but it's organized so that level 3 is much more attainable if you've mastered the previous two levels.

Level 1 (L1)
---
* Most frequently used
* Single key
* Familiar keys (arrow keys). If you're even reading this, then you probably know how to use these to move around in an editor.

Level 2 (L2)
---
* Medium usage
* Multiple key combination (usually no more than two)
* Somewhat familiar if you've used shortcuts in other apps / editors but these are mostly specific to sublime

Level 3 (L3)
---
* Least frequently used
* Multiple key combination (sometimes more than two)
* Very specific to sublime
